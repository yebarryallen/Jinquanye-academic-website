abstract: "COVID-19 greatly challenges the human health sector, and has resulted
  in a large amount of medical waste that poses various potential threats to the
  environment. In this study, we compiled relevant data released by official
  agencies and the media, and conducted data supplementation based on earlier
  studies to calculate the net value of medical waste produced in the Hubei
  Province due to COVID-19 with the help of a neural network model. Next, we
  reviewed the data related to the environmental impact of medical waste per
  unit and designed four scenarios to estimate the environmental impact of new
  medical waste generated during the pandemic. The results showed that a medical
  waste generation rate of 0.5 kg/bed/day due to COVID-19 resulted in a net
  increase of medical waste volume by about 3366.99 tons in the Hubei Province.
  In the four scenario assumptions, i.e., if the medical waste resulting from
  COVID-19 is completely incinerated, it will have a large impact on the air
  quality. If it is disposed by distillation sterilization, it will produce a
  large amount of wastewater and waste residue. Based on the results of the
  study, we propose three policy recommendations: strict control of medical
  wastewater discharge, reduction and transformation of the emitted acidic
  gases, and attention to the emission of metallic nickel in exhaust gas and
  chloride in soil. These policy recommendations provide a scientific basis for
  controlling medical waste pollution."
