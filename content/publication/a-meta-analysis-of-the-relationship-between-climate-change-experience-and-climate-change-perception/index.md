abstract: Will climate change experience shape people's climate change
  perception? To examine the evidence, we performed a pre-registered
  meta-analysis using data from 302 studies, covering 351,378 observations. Our
  results find that climate change experience only has a weak positive
  correlation with climate change awareness in general (r = 0.098, 95% CI
  0.0614, 0.1348), and the effect sizes vary considerably across different
  climate events. General hazard and temperature anomalies experiences have
  significant correlations, but other events exhibit no or neglectable effects.
  The moderator analysis showed that self-reported studies result in higher
  correlations, whereas studies based on victims' actual experiences report
  lower effect sizes. Our study suggests that people's climate change
  experiences may not be effective in shaping their awareness of climate change,
  which is likely due to people's attribution style and adaptability. The
  importance of proactive education thus is further emphasized to raise the
  awareness of climate change.
