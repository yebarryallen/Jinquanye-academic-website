abstract: This study maps the shifts in subnational climate change issue
  priority and risk perceptions in China, based on datasets from two large-scale
  surveys conducted over 13 years. Our findings reveal significant increases in
  climate change issue priority and perceived impact (19% and 13%, respectively)
  at the national scale but wider regional disparities. We highlight the needs
  for tailored and targeted communication strategies to mitigate the spatial
  mismatch between climate change perception and risk exposure.
