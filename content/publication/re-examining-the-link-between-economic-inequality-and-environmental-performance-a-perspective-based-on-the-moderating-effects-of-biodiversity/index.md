abstract: Inequality in economic distribution and environmental deterioration
  are two important issues facing the world today , and the relationship that
  exists between them is not yet clear. In what specific ways does economic
  inequality impact on the environment? Do redistributive instruments to combat
  income inequality cause environmental problems? Does the current state of the
  environment also have an impact on economic inequality? Answering these
  questions has important implications for the development of economic and
  environmental policies in countries around the world. This paper examines the
  relationship between the environment and income distribution by collecting
  panel data from 156 countries or regions around the world over the period
  2006-2018. Furthermore, we examine the changes in the marginal utility of
  economic inequality on climate under different biodiversity scenarios by
  adding biodiversity as a moderating variable. The results show that, in the
  fixed-effects model, economic inequality has a positive effect on
  environmental performance in general, and that economic inequality will mainly
  affect the sub part of ecosystem vitality , with the most significant effect
  on climate change. Biodiversity has a moderating effect on economic
  inequality, with the most significant non-linear moderating effect.
