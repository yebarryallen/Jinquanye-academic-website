Green Harvest n
1.Introduction
The quest for sustainable energy sources and poverty alleviation strategies is an imperative in today's world (Oyedepo, 2012; Carley and Konisky, 2020). As a pivotal player in global sustainability efforts, China has embarked on a transformative journey towards cleaner and more accessible energy (Liu and Gallagher, 2010). In the vast expanse of Northwest China, characterized by arid landscapes and rural poverty, the adoption of photovoltaic (PV) power generation has emerged as a beacon of hope (Sawadogo, Abiodun and Okogbue, 2020; Qiu et al., 2022). This region plays a crucial role in China's ambitious energy transition plans, as it is endowed with abundant solar resources, making it an ideal candidate for large-scale PV adoption projects (Li and Huang, 2020). The convergence of addressing energy needs and alleviating poverty through PV installations in Northwest China presents a compelling case study.
PV power generation represents a multifaceted approach to addressing critical challenges in Northwest China. This region is not only grappling with energy transformation and sustainability issues but also with rampant poverty in rural areas (Geall, Shen, and others, 2018). The application of PV systems here is twofold: for self-consumption and surplus electricity sale to the wider grid (Fernández, Payán and Santos, 2021). However, the installation of PV systems by farmers entails initial upfront costs (Schaffer and Brun, 2015), and while the government offers some procedural support and partial infrastructure facilitation, a troubling problem arises. Some unscrupulous individuals exploit participants financially under the auspices of the national poverty alleviation policy, alluring farmers with enticing promises but ultimately ensnaring them in substantial debt.

2.1. Problem statement
Some challenges loom large over the successful implementation of PV projects in Northwest China (show in the table 1). Firstly, there is a concerning trend of oversized PV projects surpassing the designated scale. Recent years have witnessed rapid growth in PV construction (Liao et al., 2022), with actual grid-connected capacity in Shaanxi exceeding the national quota by 75.72 MW since the annual scale allocation began in 2014. Secondly, the lack of synchronized planning between PV station construction and power grid development creates further complications (Sun et al., 2014). Provinces prioritize areas with abundant sunlight and favorable geographic conditions, leading to inadequate policy enforcement for PV project grid connection and lagging upgrades to the power grid infrastructure. As a result, the insufficient capacity to absorb generated electricity leads to delays in grid connection after PV stations are built.
Furthermore, the execution of policies guaranteeing the full purchase of PV electricity is less than optimal (Li et al., 2021). The guidelines from the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration emphasize that the guaranteed purchase of electricity should be settled in full by power grid companies, based on benchmark grid electricity prices and minimum guaranteed annual utilization hours. However, inspections reveal that several PV stations in Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai fall short of the minimum guaranteed annual utilization hours, while market-oriented transactions have reduced grid electricity prices within the guaranteed utilization hours, failing to meet the objectives of the guaranteed purchase policy. Additionally, delayed electricity fee settlements by local power companies, with complex workflows and extended processing times, disrupt the timely distribution of PV grid electricity fees. This situation also affects the timely allocation of renewable energy subsidies from the government, thereby impacting the economic returns of PV enterprises.
Table 1 Challenges of Implementing PV Projects in Northwest China
Challenges and Issues	Description
Oversized PV Projects	Rapid growth in PV construction, with projects exceeding designated scale, causing overcapacity issues.
Lack of Synchronized Planning	Delays in grid connection and inadequate capacity to absorb generated electricity.
Execution of Guaranteed Purchase Policies	Delayed electricity fee settlements disrupt timely distribution of PV grid electricity fees and government subsidies.
Development Model Issues	Lack of unified top-level planning, prioritization of installed capacity over long-term consequences, leading to extensive solar power abandonment.
Provincial Barriers to Electricity Trade	Lack of effective collaboration between Northwest region provinces hinders inter-province support for electricity supply. 
Synchronization with Industrial Upgrading	Inadequate synchronization of PV resource development with industrial upgrading in the region. 
Sustainability of the PV Industry	Concerns about the sustainability of the PV industry due to evolving national subsidy policies. The industry has relied on high electricity prices and subsidies, leading to a 'surface prosperity' that may be challenged
The development model of PV stations and the power grid in the Northwest region has several problems. There is no unified planning for power sources and the grid, leading to excess PV capacity that the grid cannot handle. Local governments focus on installed capacity, but ignore the long-term effects of solar power abandonment. There is also a lack of cooperation and mutual support among provinces and regions, limiting the potential of cross-border electricity transmission and consumption. Moreover, the PV resources have not been used to upgrade the regional industries, and the PV sector relies heavily on subsidies, which may not be sustainable. The Northwest region faces many challenges in maintaining its PV development.
2.2. Social need
Emphasis on Village-Level Solar PV Projects
In the north-western regions, the predominance of large-scale solar PV farms, mainly owned by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), has overshadowed the significance and impact of smaller, village-level projects. These smaller-scale projects are pivotal as they directly benefit local communities, addressing their specific energy needs and contributing more effectively to poverty alleviation.
Direct Impact on Local Communities
Village-level solar projects, such as those initiated in small villages in Shaanxi and Qinghai, have empowered local communities by providing them with access to clean and sustainable energy. For instance, a small-scale project in a remote village in Ningxia has enabled local residents to harness solar energy for household electricity needs, reducing their reliance on non-renewable energy sources and lowering energy costs. This direct access to sustainable energy sources has improved the quality of life for villagers, allowing them to utilize electricity for heating, cooking, and other daily needs.
Community Participation and Empowerment
These projects often involve the active participation of local residents in the planning, implementation, and maintenance phases. In a village in Gansu, community members were integral in deciding the location and scale of the solar PV installation, fostering a sense of ownership and community cohesion. The involvement of local residents ensures that the benefits of solar energy, such as income generated from selling surplus electricity to the grid, are equitably distributed among community members, contributing to local economic development and poverty reduction.
Tailored Solutions and Sustainable Development
Focusing on village-level projects provides insights into the specific needs, preferences, and constraints of local communities, allowing for the development of more tailored and effective solutions. For example, in a small village in Xinjiang, the implementation of a solar PV project was adapted to the local climatic conditions and energy needs, ensuring optimal performance and sustainability. By addressing the unique challenges and opportunities of each village, these projects contribute to the holistic and sustainable development of the north-western regions, ensuring that the benefits of solar energy are accessible to even the most marginalized and vulnerable groups.
2.3. Overall Mission
